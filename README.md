# Counting with Myriads: Large Numbers in the "Ordinal Myriad Scale"
## How my notes on a flight produced some kind of casual mathematics paper...
#### Andrew Vella (2025)

Suppose you are up late at night, with a broken leg. As is the custom, you count sheep. (one, two, three). It has been a few nights. It's going to be a few more restless nights. At night, you keep counting sheep and during the day, you count out reps for your exercises. This workout involves lying in bed, contracting muscles in place hundreds of times a day. It's boring, so to pass the time, you also play an incremental game. You click buttons and numbers go up, (one thousand, two thousand, three thousand). As you watch the game tick, you ponder a question. "Where do the names of these numbers come from?" As the numbers count higher, (one million, two million, three million), you have more questions. "Do the names ever run out? How many different designations for numbers are there?" As it was for Alice, you find the rabbit hole to be deeper than expected. 

You learn that around 1995, Alan Weschler and the late John Conway developed a system for naming powers of one million. Given a billion is a million squared, and a trillion is a million cubed; a million to the fourth can be named for the latin word for four, giving one quadrillion. After using 999 Latin numerals, the thousandth power of a million is then called "millinillion". This scheme can continue, "nilli" repeating into infinity. The names become long strings of latinglish spaghetti. You fork "Conway's illion Converter" (by a Japanese programmer named Kyoda). You devise a way to shorten many of the long Latin names, but so many more numbers have names that cannot be shortened at all. Well, that's ok, you move on with life.

You get on a plane, for the first flight since your injury. You're flying out to see your grandma. You have a book to pass the time, but your bag is stowed under the seat and getting that is a bother. So you play the counting game, and you remember that rabbit hole, and you ask questions: "What if there was a way to just drop all the spaghetti Latin, counting in some kind of Greek scale? Given one hundred squared is one myriad, can I count with powers of a myriad?" It turns out you can do that, and more...

The Ordinal Myriad Scale is an alternative to the scales for naming large numbers. The US short scale, and British long scales, can be substituted for this method with ease. Confusion between scales can be eliminated, and so can verbose Latin-English portmanteaus. 

### Rules of the Count
What? There are rules? Yes. While naming numbers should be fun, the "Googology" Wiki does suffer from a lack of restraint. A page describing a single number can become a dogpile of tangential links, all of which are variations on "I call this something else. I named it this based on that. Look at me. Look at my notation. Look at my website." To learn about the history of large numbers, one has to sift through the noise. Why are there rules? They are here to ensure this scheme is coherent, so you can actually count really, really high. (A good scheme takes a surprising amount of effort, evil schemes can vary a bit.)  

* Two numeric values cannot share a name. "Two Hundred" should refer to 200 every time.

* Names need to be pronounceable and distinct when spoken, distinguished by something other than a silent mark.

* Large and small numbers should be considered.
  * If 10^10 has a name, and 10^10^10 has a name, then (10^10)^10 should have a name. This rule ensures that the numbers in between can be counted. Note that 10^10^10 is equal to 10^(10^10) not (10^10)^10. 10^100;0000;0000 is not 10^100. 

* The use of adjectives should be limited, except for repetition to infinity. 
  * "Great Great Great Great Myriad" can be a name if "Great" is defined. "Great Grand Groovy Grouped Gyriad" is noise.

* With the exception of "primitive numbers" numbers should be defined in terms of other numbers, with names constructed from simpler names. 
  * Primitive numbers are a small group of cardinal numbers with names that are not defined in terms of other numbers. Examples include: zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, (one) hundred, (one) thousand, (one) myriad. Constructed numbers include: two-hundred, twenty-five, two-hundred-twenty-five, and five-hundred-twenty-five-thousand-six-hundred. All of the "-illion" numbers are constructed with the Latin prefix.

* Schemes for constructing numbers should be based on the names of primitive numbers in (spoken or written) language. 
  * "Abcdefg" could be the name of some large number in some alphabetic counting system (one hundred is "a", the square of that "b", the 26th "z", the 27th "aa", and so on). Such a scheme breaks this rule, because  such as "Abcedefg" is only defined when "a" is defined (as some arbitrary number). In other words, names should be mapped to numeric values, not to a floating pointer like "a". 

* Using alphabetically constructed numbers is acceptable if two criteria are met. First, the alphabet is commonly used for communication. Second, the number is commonly used for counting. 
  * Suppose a letter's position in the alphabet denoted an exponent, such that "Myriad-Beta" denoted the square of a myriad, "Myriad-Gamma" the third, and so on. The myriad is always equal to ten to the fourth. Every alphabetic number is a power of the base "myriad" and is therefore always equal to a constant numeric value. 
  * For counterexamples, try defining numbers with a contrived nonsense alphabet, a contrived nonsense number, or even both. "Myriad-Zaphele" or "Garillon-Omega" are almost certainly not numbers by a reasonable standard, but "Garillion-Zaphele" certainly is not.

### Counting With Myriads and Ordinals
So what is a myriad and how do we count to it? Here is a table of the numbers between One and One Myriad:
| n  | Name   | n  | Name       | n      | Name                       |      
|----|--------|----|------------|--------|----------------------------|
| 1  | One    | 12 | Twelve     | 30     | Thirty                     |
| 2  | Two    | 13 | Thirteen   | 40     | Forty                      |
| 3  | Three  | 14 | Fourteen   | 50     | Fifty                      |
| 4  | Four   | 15 | Fifteen    | 60     | Sixty                      | 
| 5  | Five   | 16 | Sixteen    | 70     | Seventy                    |
| 6  | Six    | 17 | Seventeen  | 80     | Eighty                     |
| 7  | Seven  | 18 | Eighteen   | 90     | Ninety                     |
| 8  | Eight  | 19 | Nineteen   | 100    | One Hundred                |
| 9  | Nine   | 20 | Twenty     | 500    | Five Hundred               |
| 10 | Ten    | 21 | Twenty One | 1000   | Ten Hundred (One Thousand) |
| 11 | Eleven | 22 | Twenty Two | 1;0000 | One Myriad  (Ten Thousand) |

Thousands can be used to count, but tens of hundreds and myriads will be used here.

How do we count higher?
* A myriad is equal to a hundred hundred, or ten to the power of four. 
* A myriad is written as 1;0000. Two myriad is 2;0000. A “myriadth” is 1 / 1;0000. 
* The square of a myriad is 1;0000;0000.  
* Use cardinals for products and ordinals for powers. (2;0000 is "Two Myriad", and 1;0000;0000 is the "Square Myriad". 

If you prefer a different choice of ordinal, there are three different kinds of ordinals for use: 
* Tetric: Square, Cubic, Tetric; or Duplic, Triplic, Tetric.
* English: Second, Third, Fourth.
* Greek: Dueteros, Tritos, Tetaros.

Also note that when counting with English ordinals, use "of the" to distinguish between denotations, One Hundred of the Second Myriad (1;0000^10), is smaller than One-Hundred-Second Myriad (1;0000^408). To shorten "of the" use "of".

| e  | Name        | e  | Name               |
|----|-------------|----|--------------------|
| e0 | One         | e5 | Ten Myriad         |
| e1 | Ten         | e6 | One Hundred Myriad | 
| e2 | One Hundred | e7 | Ten Hundred Myriad |  
| e3 | Ten Hundred | e8 | Square Myriad      |
| e4 | One Myriad  | e9 | Ten Square Myriad  |


| e   | Name                      |
|-----|---------------------------|
| e10 | One Hundred Square Myriad |
| e11 | Ten Hundred Square Myriad |
| e12 | Cubic Myriad              |
| e13 | Ten Cubic Myriad          | 
| e14 | One Hundred Cubic Myriad  | 


If you would rather not say "myriad" so often, just drop the word altogether. for example "One Tetric Myriad" can be called "One Tetric"

### "Ordinal" Denotations: Counting Beyond Powers of the Myriad
Now, once you reach the Myriadth Myriad, things start getting a bit repetitive. The square of the Myriadth Myriad is the "Second Myriadth Myriad", and from this the "Myriadth Myriadth Myriad" is derived, which is followed by more repeating ordinals. For a band-aid solution, we can use a little Ancient Greek and an adjective. Let's call the "Myriadth Myriad" the "Ordinal Myriad", from "ordinal".
The "Myriadth, Myriadth Myriad" can be called the "Diordinal Myriad" because it is named with two "Myriadth" ordinals. From this a myriad of a myriad "myriadths" can be accounted for, and named "Myriodic Myriad". 

The following tables demonstrate how to count to Myriordinal Myriad:

| e              | Name                                                |

| e(4(e(4(e4)))) | Myriordinal Myriad                                  |

Note that "ordinal", with a prefix, refers to the number of repeated ordinals that would otherwise be needed to describe a number ("Myriadth", "Myric", or "Myriakostos"). Using English Ordinals, "Ordinal Myriad" refers to the "Myriadth Myriad". (1;0000^1;0000). "Square Ordinal Myriad" refers to the "Sqaure Myriadth Myriad" ((1;0000^1;0000)^2). Diordinal Myriad" refers to the "Myriadth, Myriadth Myriad". ((1;0000^1;0000)^1;0000). "Triordinal Myriad" refers to the "Myriadth, Myriadth, Myriadth Myriad" (((1;0000^1;0000)^1;0000)^1;0000) and so on. Ultimately, myriads are named with repeating "Myriodic"s as they approach infinity.

It is tempting to start counting Myriordinals. Suppose "Myriordinal Myriad" is also called "Extrordinal Myriad", "Myriordinal Myriordinal Myriad" called "Diextrodic Myriad" and so on. Arriving at "Myriextrordinal Myriad", such a number could be renamed "Exditrordinal Myriad". Arriving at "Exmyriatrordinal Myriad" and then "Exmyriatrordinal Exmyriatrordinal Myriad", "Exdiextrordinal Myriad" can be coined. Arriving at "Exmyriaextrordinal Exmyriaextrodic Myriad", "Exdiexmyriaexordinal Myriad" can be coined. How nice and readable!

Ok let's try something else. Let's use hyperoperations to define names. See, given a myriad is 10 to the power of four, a power of ten can be converted to a power of a myriad by setting the base accordingly and dividing the power by four. Thus, the Ordinal Myriad (e4;0000) is equal to a myriad raised to the power of the myriad, and the Diordinal Myriad is a myriad to the power of the square myriad. The Myriordinal Myriad must be equal to a myriad to the power of the ordinal myriad, ir a myriad tetrated to three. What? What's tetration? What's a hyperoperation?

### Hyperoperations Definition
A hyperoperation h, on base b, is defined as the repeating of operation (h-1) h times, on base b.
There are an infinite number of such operations, the first of which is addition.

* Addition is defined as repeated succession. (2 + 3) = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
* Multiplication is repeated addition. (2 * 3) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
* Exponentiation is repeated multiplication. (2^3) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
* Tetration is repeated exponentiation, 2^^3 = 2^2^2 = 2^4 = 16
* Pentation is repeated tetration. 2^^^3 is (2^^2^^2) = 2^^(2^2) = 2^^4 = 2^2^2^2 = 2^16 = 6;5536
* Hexation is repeated pentation. Heptation is next, then octation, enneation, decation...
* Hyperoperations continue beyond myriatation, to infinity (apeiratation).

### Counting Even Higher: "Hyperoperative Denotations"
"Myriad", "Ordinal Myriad", and "Myriordinal Myriad" is a nice trio, but approaching infinity with ordinals requires an infinite number of adjectives. 

Ok, suppose that if "Triplic" means "to the third power", then "Tetrated Triplic" means "tetrated to the third" but that is too long. So, let's take the "-ated" suffix, replace it with the "-os" suffix from Greek Ordinals and create a compound word. "Tetrostriplic Myriad" is 1;0000^^3 and the square of that is "Square Tetrostriplic Myriad". (10^8)^^3 is the "Tetrostriplic Square Myriad". Finally (1;0000^^3)^^2 is the "Tetrosduplic Tetrostriplic Myriad" That should work.

So, from this table it is evident that values between tetrosdulpic myriad and tetrostriplic myriad are covered by combining hyperoprative and ordinal denotations. We can continue to combine hyperoperative and ordinal names to extend the ordinals for each hyperoperative, such that "Myriordinal, Myriordinal Myriad" can be called "Diordinal Tetrostriplic Myriad." "Myriordinal Tetrostriplic Myriad" can be called "Tetrostetric Myriad" and so on.

Let's define a table with a notation called "h". (x)h(y) takes hyperoperation x in the myriad and raises it to y, such that 4h2 is equal to Tetrosduplic Myriad or (1;0000^^2)


| h          | Name                                           |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 4h0        | One                                            |
| 4h1        | One Myriad                                     |
| 4h2        | Tetrosduplic Myriad                            |
| 4h3        | Tetrostriplic Myriad                           |
| 4h10       | Tetrosdecic Myriad                             |
| 4h20       | Tetrosicosic Myriad                            |
| 4h30       | Tetrostricontic Myriad                         |
| 4h100      | Tetroshectic Myriad                            |
| 4h101      | Tetroshectahenic Myriad                        |
| 4h102      | Tetroshectaduplic Myriad                       |
| 4h103      | Tetroshectatriplic Myriad                      |
| 4h110      | Tetroshectadecic Myriad                        | 
| 4h120      | Tetroshectaicosic Myriad                       |
| 4h130      | Tetroshectatricontic Myriad                    |
| 4h200      | Tetrosdihectic Myriad                          |
| 4h300      | Tetrostrihectic Myriad                         |
| 4h1000     | Tetrosdecahectic Myriad                        |
| 4h2000     | Tetrosicosahectic Myriad                       |
| 4h3000     | Tetrostricontahectic Myriad                    |
| 4h1;0000   | Pentosduplic Myriad (Tetroshectahectic Myriad) | 

A similar table exists for each (x)h(y), where x is an integer greater than or equal to four, and y is an integer in the range of zero to one myriad (inclusive).
Therefore hyperoperative names are defined to infinity. The myriad myriated to the myriad can be called the "Myrioshectahectic Myriad", the "Myriosmyric Myriad", the "Myriosordinal Myriad", or even the "Myriahenosduplic Myriad". All of these names are equivalent, and similar equivalences hold for all the hyperoperations. Additionally, recall how ordinals were used to tabulate numbers between tetrosduplic myriad and tetrostriplic myriad. A similar set of ordinals exists for values between each hyperoperation. By the methods described above, every integer between One and Myriosordinal Myriad can be named. (Fractions between the integers can also be named by the swapping the cardinal "myriad" for the ordinal "myriadth".) 

It is possible to keep counting ("Myriordosmyriordinal Myriad" comes to mind) but this is certainly enough to satisfy even the most demanding number goblin. For all intents and purposes, you can now count to something that might as well be infinity. Should you feel the need to clim higher, hyperoperations do continue to infinity, so they should provide for the journey onward. 

### Storing and Computed Large Myriads
So it is pretty trivial to store and compare integers in the range of 32 bits. Most computers have a data type for that (integer) that can store any integer in the range of about -(2 * 10^9) to (2 * 10^9), or negative twenty square myriad to positive twenty square myriad (Two billion? That is just silly.) Integers in this range can be stored and computed directly. In other words, your computer can do 5 + 5 just fine, and it can tell you if 5 is greater than 0.

Using scientific notation, we can store larger numbers at the cost of precision. A number can be defined as (f, u) where f is a floating point and u is an integer power of ten, such that (f, u) is equal to f * (10^u). It is easy to store numbers on orders of magnitude comparable to **(f * 10^20;0000;0000)** or **(f * 10^(-20;0000;0000))** this way. We can count larger than five diordinal myriad or smaller than a fifth diordinal myriadth.

How do we compare numbers that are in vastly different orders of magnitude? This is easy to do for relational operators and arithmetic operators less than tetration 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, roots, and exponentiation). Just ignore insignificant figures. When performing an operation on numbers p and q, if p is less than or equal to (q * 10^-6), set p to the identity for that operation. (Add 0, multiply by 1, etc.) In other words, if q is insignificant when compared to p, then p dominates q. 

Lets add a third parameter r for (f, u, r) such that 
**(f, u, r) = f * (10^(u + 4;0000;0000r))**
When u = 4;0000;0000, we set u to 0 and increment r. 

We can keep adding as many r parameters as we want:
**(f, u, r, r1) = f * (10^(u + 4;0000;0000r + 4;0000;0000r1))**
When r = 4;0000;0000, set r to 0 and increment r1, r1 increments r2, and so on.

I chose 4;0000;0000 as the max for u and r in order to make better use of integer memory (compared to a max of 4;0000, which is the more readable, but less efficient choice). With an unsigned integer a max of 40;0000;0000 is possible. However it is important that the most significant digit is four, to ease converting between powers of ten and powers of the myriad.

How much is **(1, 0, 4;0000;0000)** It's about **(10^(16 * 10^16))** or Four Tetrordinal Myraid. Between the myriad of four zeroes, the tetrordinal making four of the four zeroes and the cardinal four, this is just a nice four-tastic number.

### Conclusion
See, I want to make an incremental game, but the way large numbers are counted made them difficult to say, and notations rob players of the sense of scale. I wanted a remedy. I want a new way to name the big numbers. I am tired of saying "illion". Why say "Two to the power of six times three to the power of five" when you can say "Hexic Two Pentic Three"? If you like saying "two thousand" instead of "twenty myriad", that is okay. I still count in thousands. I will also still say "one million" instead of "One square thousand". That said, when I see (10^3003) get called "millinillion", or "mlastomillion", or "millillion"  I'll think to myself "What is that in myriads? 3000 divided by four is 750. So it's Heptahectapenticontic Myriad, but I'll call it the 750th Myriad. Ok, so (10^3003) is one thousand of the 750th myriad."  Instead of asking "Undecillion, how many zeroes is that?" I'll call it "Ninth Myriad", or "Enneaic Myriad" if I feel fancy, or even "Enatos Myriad" if I feel really fancy. "Ninth Myriad" is (1;0000^9), while "undecillion" is (1,000^12) in the USA and (10^6)^12) across the Atlantic. Myriads are easier to work with. 

You might be asking "How are you? Is your leg better? Are you feeling ok?". Yes, I am feeling better, getting stronger and faster. I no longer have to count sheep at night. I do not have to wait for my painkillers to work. Now I get to take walks outside, and keep up with the bird photography as Spring migration begins. Truly, I think it takes a kind of intense tedium to become so invested in counting such big numbers. Children love to count big when they are learning to count, but only someone with far to much time to count would ever tabulate such impractically large numbers as "Myriordinal Myriad".
